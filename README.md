# Modeling-NBA-MVP-Shares-Using-Bayesian-Beta-Regression

The National Basketball Association, or NBA, gives out a litany of awards every season. From awarding
outstanding defense, to acknowledging tremendous improvement in a player, no award is more prestigious
than the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Each year, the NBA media votes on which player will
receive the award, and the player with the highest vote share wins. As statisticians, this begs the
question: How can we predict who will receive this award? In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach
to modeling, creating a Bayesian beta regression model to predict the MVP vote share a given NBA
player will receive at the end of the season.
